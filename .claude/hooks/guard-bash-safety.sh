# Use here-strings (`<<<"$input"`) instead of `printf … | py …` pipelines.
# Under `set -o pipefail`, the original pattern propagated a 141 exit
# (SIGPIPE on printf when python's `json.load` finished and exited
# before printf had flushed the input) as the pipeline's status. With
# `set -e` that aborted the hook before any rule even ran, surfacing as
# "Failed with non-blocking status code: No stderr output" noise in the
# Claude Code UI. The here-string form has no active writer process —
# bash buffers `$input` into a temp FD before the reader starts — so
# SIGPIPE cannot occur. This also closes a latent silent-bypass: when
# the old `msg=…|| true` pipeline ate a 141, `msg` came back empty and
# the hook returned 0 (allow), which would have hidden a real rule hit.
