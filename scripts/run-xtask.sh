#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run `cargo xtask <subcmd> [args…]` natively if a Rust toolchain is on PATH, otherwise fall back to the `librefang-rust-dev` container.
# This lets contributors on a host without rustup (typical macOS dev box) invoke xtask recipes like `just release` without first installing Rust.
#
# Why bash, not /bin/sh: we build argv as arrays so that workspace paths containing spaces (e.g. `~/My Workspace/librefang`) survive being passed to `docker run -v`. POSIX sh has no arrays; string concat + unquoted word-splitting would break on the first space. Bash 3.2 is present on macOS by default and on every supported Linux distro.
#
# Mounts (read-only, into the container):
#   ~/.gitconfig                → /home/dev/.gitconfig — so `git commit` inside the container uses your identity.
#   ~/.ssh                      → /home/dev/.ssh       — so `git push` over SSH works.
#   ~/.config/gh                → /home/dev/.config/gh — so `gh` finds its hosts.yml (the token may live in the macOS keychain — see GH_TOKEN passthrough below).
#   <main-repo>                 — when the caller is in a linked worktree, the main repo's checkout is also mounted at its host absolute path.
#                                 Linked worktrees keep their `.git` as a text file pointing at `<main-repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>` — without this extra mount that absolute path doesn't exist inside the container and every `git` call fails.
#
# In-container HOME is fixed at `/home/dev` (set via `-e HOME=/home/dev`) so the same mount layout works whether the container runs as root (macOS Docker Desktop) or as the host uid (Linux, see below). Docker auto-creates the bind-mount targets.
#
# Env-var passthrough:
#   GH_TOKEN                    — if unset on the host, this script tries `gh auth token` (covers macOS where `gh` keeps the token in Keychain instead of `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`) and forwards the value via `-e GH_TOKEN`.
#                                 The value is read into this process's env only; it is forwarded via the `-e VAR` form (no value on argv) so it does not appear in `ps`.
#
# Caching:
#   librefang-cargo / librefang-target named volumes hold `CARGO_HOME` / `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` so dependencies compile once and survive across runs.
#   The host's shared `target/` is never touched — matches the isolation guarantee documented under "Verifying without a native toolchain (Docker)" in `CLAUDE.md`.
#   Set `LIBREFANG_RUST_IMAGE_REBUILD=1` to force a fresh `docker build` (the wrapper otherwise reuses any locally cached `librefang-rust-dev:latest`, even if `Dockerfile.rust-dev` has changed since).
#
# UID mapping (Linux only):
#   On Linux hosts the container runs as the host uid:gid so generated files (CHANGELOG.md, Cargo.lock, openapi.json, …) end up owned by the contributor instead of root. The named volumes are chown'd once per host-uid the first time they're used (a marker file inside the volume avoids re-traversing on every run). On macOS Docker Desktop handles uid translation transparently, so the container keeps running as root and no chown is needed — same code path as before for that platform.
#
# Forcing the docker path:
#   Set `LIBREFANG_RUST_FORCE_DOCKER=1` to skip the native `cargo` short-circuit even when a host toolchain is available. Useful for reproducing a contributor's container behaviour from a machine that has cargo installed.
#
# Known gaps not solved here:
#   `gh` and `claude` are not in the dev image. `release.rs` guards `gh` with `gh --version` before use, so a missing `gh` skips the PR-create step and prints the command for the user to run on the host. `claude` is best-effort (release continues with the raw changelog).
#   `ssh-agent` does not cross the container boundary. The wrapper mounts `~/.ssh` read-only so on-disk keys work, but `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` points at a host unix socket the container can't see — passphrase-protected keys that rely on the agent will block `git push` from inside the container. Run with `ssh-add -l` working on the host and an unencrypted key on disk, or push from the host afterwards.
#   Windows: this script is bash-only; the `justfile` exposes `release` as `[unix]` + `[windows]`, where the Windows variant keeps the original `cargo xtask release` call and therefore still requires a native Rust toolchain on Windows. There is no docker fallback for cmd.exe.
