//! Error types for the RL trajectory exporter.
//!
//! The exporter speaks to several different upstream services (W&B today,
//! Tinker and Atropos in follow-up PRs) over HTTP. The error enum is kept
//! flat and string-payload-heavy on purpose: callers (CLI, dashboard,
//! runtime telemetry hook) generally want to render the upstream's own
//! message back to the operator rather than translate it. Distinct
//! variants only exist where the call site needs to branch on the cause
//! (auth retry vs upstream-4xx surface vs transport bounce).

use thiserror::Error;

/// Errors that can occur while exporting a trajectory.
///
/// `NetworkError` is the catch-all for transport-layer failures (DNS,
/// connect, read timeout, TLS, …). Surface the inner message verbatim;
/// upstream-specific 4xx bodies use `UpstreamRejected` instead so the
/// status code stays inspectable.
///
/// `#[non_exhaustive]` so future variants (e.g. a structured
/// `RateLimited { retry_after }`) can land non-breaking — matches the
/// stance on `ExportTarget` and reserves room for the next obvious
/// addition.
