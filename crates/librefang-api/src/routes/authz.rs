//! RBAC follow-up — admin-only effective-permissions snapshot endpoint.
//!
//! Backs the dashboard's permission simulator (RBAC M6, #3209). Returns
//! the raw RBAC inputs configured for one user across all four layers
//! (per-user `tool_policy` + `tool_categories` from M3, `memory_access`
//! from M3, `budget` from M5, `channel_tool_rules` from M3 + channel
//! bindings) so an admin debugging a denial can see every contributing
//! slice in one place without mentally walking the gate path.
//!
//! The endpoint is deliberately a **getter / serializer** — it does NOT
//! recompute the four-layer intersection that decides per-call tool
//! gates. That decision lives in the runtime + kernel gate path
//! (`AuthManager::resolve_user_tool_decision` + per-agent
//! `ToolPolicy::check_tool` + global `ApprovalPolicy.channel_rules`)
//! and is the single source of truth; reproducing it here would
//! silently drift on every gate-logic change.
//!
//! Gating mirrors the M5 `/api/audit/*` and `/api/budget/users/*`
//! endpoints: anonymous callers and Viewer/User roles are denied with a
//! `PermissionDenied` audit entry, only `Admin+` proceeds. The
//! diagnostic surfaces the same identity / policy data those endpoints
//! already expose, so the trust ceiling is identical.
