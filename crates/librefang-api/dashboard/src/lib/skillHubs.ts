/**
 * Federated skill hub configuration — single source of truth for the
 * Skills page's hub metadata (colors, glyphs, CLI templates) and the
 * shared UI bits (HubBadge, HubSourceBar, etc. — see
 * `components/SkillHubBar.tsx`).
 *
 * Backend already exposes per-hub endpoints:
 *   GET /api/skills            (installed)
 *   GET /api/skills/registry   (FangHub)
 *   GET /clawhub/{search,browse,install}
 *   GET /clawhub-cn/{search,browse,install}
 *   GET /skillhub/{search,browse,install}
 *
 * The dashboard's `lib/queries/skills.ts` and `lib/mutations/skills.ts`
 * already expose query/mutation hooks for each. This config layer
 * unifies how the UI presents them.
