//! Merkle hash chain audit trail for security-critical actions.
//!
//! Every auditable event is appended to an append-only log where each entry
//! contains the SHA-256 hash of its own contents concatenated with the hash of
//! the previous entry, forming a tamper-evident chain (similar to a blockchain).
//!
//! When a database connection is provided (`with_db`), entries are persisted to
//! the `audit_entries` table (schema V8) so the trail survives daemon restarts.
