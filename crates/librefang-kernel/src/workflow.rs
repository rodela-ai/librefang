//! Workflow engine — multi-step agent pipeline execution.
//!
//! A workflow defines a sequence of steps where each step routes
//! a task to a specific agent. Steps can:
//! - Pass their output as input to the next step
//! - Run in sequence (pipeline) or in parallel (fan-out)
//! - Conditionally skip based on previous output
//! - Loop until a condition is met
//! - Store outputs in named variables for later reference
//!
//! Workflows are defined as Rust structs or loaded from JSON/TOML files.
