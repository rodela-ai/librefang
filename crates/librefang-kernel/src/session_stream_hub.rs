//! Session-scoped fan-out for in-turn `StreamEvent`s.
//!
//! The kernel's streaming entry point (`send_message_streaming_*`) creates a
//! per-turn `mpsc::channel<StreamEvent>` between the agent loop (producer) and
//! the HTTP/SSE handler that originally triggered the turn (consumer). That
//! single-consumer channel is fine for the originating client, but it makes
//! it impossible for any *other* client to observe the same turn — the
//! desktop app cannot watch a conversation the CLI just kicked off, and a
//! reconnecting browser tab cannot resume mid-turn.
//!
//! `SessionStreamHub` is a side-channel keyed by `SessionId`: a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` sender per active session. The kernel installs a
//! short forwarder task that drains the producer mpsc, fans each event out
//! to both the original caller (via a non-blocking `try_send`) and the
//! broadcast channel. Any number of late attachers can `subscribe()` and
//! start receiving events from the moment they connect.
//!
//! Hub entries are created lazily on first publish or first subscribe and
//! pruned when no live receivers remain (`gc_idle`). Lossiness is intentional:
//! a slow attacher (including the originating caller) lags rather than
//! backpressuring the producer or starving other attachers.
