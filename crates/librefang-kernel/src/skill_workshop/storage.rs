/// outcome is one extra pending candidate that ages out on the next

///    same gate that blocks marketplace skills, so a malicious draft
///    cannot sit in `pending/` waiting to trick a sleepy reviewer.
/// 2. **Dedup:** if a pending candidate with the same `(source kind,
///    name, prompt_context)` already exists for this agent, the write
///    is skipped — a deterministic heuristic that fires every turn
///    for the same teaching signal would otherwise pile up duplicate
///    candidates.
/// 3. **Cap:** if writing this candidate would exceed `max_pending`,
///    the oldest candidate (by `captured_at`) is deleted first.
///    `max_pending = 0` is treated as a hard "do not store" signal —
///    [`save_candidate`] returns `Ok(false)` without writing.
/// 4. **Optional TTL:** if `max_pending_age_days` is `Some(n)`, any
///    candidate older than `n` days is reaped before the cap check.
///    Defaults to `None`, preserving the historical "cap-LRU is the
///    only aging mechanism" behaviour.
/// 5. **Atomicity:** the file is written to a temp path and renamed
///    into place. A crash between write and rename leaves the temp
///    file (cleaned up by `prune_orphan_temp_files`) but never a
///    half-written `.toml`.
