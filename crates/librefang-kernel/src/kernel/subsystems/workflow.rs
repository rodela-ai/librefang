//! Workflow subsystem — orchestration engines + scheduler + queue.
//!
//! Bundles every long-lived orchestration handle that previously sat as
//! a flat field on `LibreFangKernel`: the workflow execution `engine`
//! (renamed from the original `workflows` field to avoid the
//! `self.workflows.workflows` collision), workflow `template_registry`,
//! event-driven `triggers`, the `background` agent executor, the
//! `cron_scheduler`, and the lane-based `command_queue`.
