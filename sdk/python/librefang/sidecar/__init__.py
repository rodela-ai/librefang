"""LibreFang sidecar channel adapter SDK.

Write a channel adapter in Python that runs as a supervised subprocess
of LibreFang, speaking newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio:

    from librefang.sidecar import SidecarAdapter, run_stdio, Content, protocol

    class MyAdapter(SidecarAdapter):
        capabilities = ["typing"]

        async def on_send(self, cmd):
            ...  # deliver cmd.text / cmd.content to your platform

        async def produce(self, emit):
            async for m in my_platform_stream():
                emit(protocol.message(m.user_id, m.user_name,
                                      content=Content.text(m.text)))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        run_stdio(MyAdapter())

See :mod:`librefang.sidecar.runtime` for the daemon-restart vs.
platform-reconnect responsibility split.
