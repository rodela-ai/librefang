# Hello, LibreFang!

LibreFang is an open-source Agent Operating System built in Rust.

## Why LibreFang?

"Libre" means freedom. We believe an open-source project should be truly open — not just in license, but in governance, contribution, and collaboration.

## Features

- **14 Rust crates** — modular, fast, and memory-safe
- **40 messaging channels** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, and 37 more
- **60 bundled skills** — ready to use out of the box
- **16 security layers** — WASM sandbox, RBAC, audit trails, and more
- **2,100+ tests** — zero clippy warnings

## Quick Start

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key"
librefang init && librefang start
# Open http://127.0.0.1:4545
```
