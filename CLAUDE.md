# LibreFang — Agent Instructions

## ⚠️ Before any work: verify you are in a worktree, not the main tree

The very first action in any task that will edit files **must** be:
```bash
test -d "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.git" && echo main || echo linked
```
- prints `main` → you are in the **main worktree**. **Stop.** Run
  `git worktree add /tmp/librefang-<feature> -b <feature-branch> origin/main`
  and continue all work from that path.
- prints `linked` → you are in a **linked worktree**. Continue.

Why this test: git stores the main worktree's `.git` as a directory,
and a linked worktree's `.git` as a small text file pointing at
`<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>`. So `[ -d <toplevel>/.git ]` is true
exactly in the main worktree. This is the same check
`.claude/hooks/forbid-main-worktree.sh` uses internally; do not
substitute `git rev-parse --git-dir` (its output is path-shape and
varies with cwd) or path-matching against `pwd` (every developer's
clone lives somewhere different).

The `forbid-main-worktree` hook (`.claude/hooks/forbid-main-worktree.sh`)
will block edits and mutating git commands targeted at the main tree if
you forget — but the hook is a safety net, not your plan.

### Other AI safety hooks (`.claude/hooks/`)

`guard-bash-safety.sh` (PreToolUse on Bash) blocks:
- Force-push to `main` / `master` (incl. `+main` refspec) — get explicit user OK first
- `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign` on commit/push/rebase/merge/am/cherry-pick/pull
- Staging known-sensitive files (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`,
  `credentials*`, `secrets*`, `vault_*.key`); also broad `git add -A` / `git add .`
  (CLAUDE.md global rule: stage specific paths)
- Commit messages containing Claude attribution (`Co-Authored-By: Claude`,
  `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]`, etc.)
- `rm -rf` against dangerous targets (`/`, `~`, `$HOME`, `target`, `.git`,
  `/Users`, `/usr`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/opt`, …)
- Daemon launches: `librefang start`, `target/{debug,release}/librefang start|daemon`
  (port 4545 contention with the user's session — Live Integration Testing is human-only)

`session-start-worktree-check.sh` (SessionStart) emits a banner telling
the model whether the session started in the main tree or a linked worktree,
and warns if `core.hooksPath` hasn't been pointed at `.githooks/`.

### Version-controlled git-side hooks (`scripts/hooks/`)

These run inside `git` itself (regardless of which tool invoked the commit),
giving defense in depth on top of the Claude Code PreToolUse layer.

- `pre-commit` — runs `cargo fmt --check` on staged Rust files; CHANGELOG
  duplicate-`[Unreleased]` guard; CHANGELOG `(@user)` attribution check on
  staged additions to `[Unreleased]` (#3400); `detect-secrets` scan against
  `.secrets.baseline` (soft-warn if not installed). Target: < 2s.
- `pre-push` — `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`;
  OpenAPI / SDK drift detection — fails the push if `openapi.json` or
  generated SDKs are stale. Expected 30-90s on a warm cache.
- `commit-msg` — rejects commit messages containing Claude / Anthropic
  attribution (catches heredocs and `git commit -F file` that the PreToolUse
  Bash hook cannot see).

**Enable once per clone** by running setup:
```bash
just setup        # or: cargo xtask setup
```
This sets `git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks`, which makes the in-repo
hooks active and keeps them current with `git pull` automatically. The
`session-start-worktree-check.sh` banner reminds you if it isn't configured
yet.

## Project Overview
LibreFang is an open-source Agent Operating System written in Rust (24 crates in `crates/`, plus `xtask/`).
- Config: `~/.librefang/config.toml`
- Default API: `http://127.0.0.1:4545`
- CLI binary: `target/release/librefang` on Linux/macOS,
  `target/release/librefang.exe` on Windows (debug builds at the
  matching `target/debug/` path)

### Crate map
- **Core types & utilities**: `librefang-types`, `librefang-http`, `librefang-wire`, `librefang-telemetry`, `librefang-testing`, `librefang-migrate`
- **Kernel**: `librefang-kernel` (orchestration), `librefang-kernel-handle` (trait used by runtime to call kernel without circular dep), `librefang-kernel-router`, `librefang-kernel-metering`
- **Runtime**: `librefang-runtime` (agent loop, tools, plugins), `librefang-runtime-mcp`, `librefang-runtime-oauth`, `librefang-runtime-wasm`
- **LLM drivers**: `librefang-llm-driver` (trait + error types — interface only) and `librefang-llm-drivers` (concrete provider impls: anthropic, openai, gemini, …)
- **Memory**: `librefang-memory` (SQLite substrate)
- **Surface**: `librefang-api` (HTTP server + dashboard SPA bundled at `crates/librefang-api/dashboard/`), `librefang-cli`, `librefang-desktop`
- **Extensibility**: `librefang-skills`, `librefang-hands`, `librefang-extensions`, `librefang-channels`

## Build & Verify Workflow
**Do NOT run `cargo build` or `cargo run` locally.**
**`cargo test` is allowed only when scoped with `-p <crate>` / `--package <crate>`** —
the unscoped, workspace-wide form is blocked because it contends with the user's
other sessions on the shared `target/` directory. Full workspace build / test
runs in CI.

After every change, run:
```bash
cargo check --workspace --lib                          # Compile-check only
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Zero warnings
cargo test -p <crate>                                  # Only when verifying behavior in one crate
```

### CI test lanes (refs #3696)

CI splits tests into two separate jobs so a unit failure surfaces quickly:

- **Unit-fast** (`Test / Unit (lib+bin)`, ~2 min): `cargo nextest run --workspace -E 'kind(lib) | kind(bin)' --no-fail-fast`
  — lib and binary unit tests only; no integration test binaries. Run this locally for quick iteration.
- **Integration** (`Test / Ubuntu (shard N/4)`, ~10-20 min): sharded across 4 Ubuntu runners via
  `--partition hash:N/4`; also single jobs on macOS and Windows. Runs all `--tests` targets.

The unit-fast lane uses nextest's `-E 'kind(lib) | kind(bin)'` filter rather
than `--lib --bins` because the latter errors with "no library targets found"
when a `-p <crate>` selector targets a binary-only crate
(`librefang-cli`, `librefang-desktop`). The expression form matches whichever
kinds the selected crates actually have, so the selective CI lane stays green
when a PR touches only `librefang-cli/main.rs` (or when a stale-base diff
drags it in).

Local equivalents:
```bash
# Fast lane — unit tests only:
cargo nextest run --workspace -E 'kind(lib) | kind(bin)' --no-fail-fast

# Full validation — integration tests (mirrors the Ubuntu shard lane):
cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast
```

## MANDATORY: Integration Testing (refs #3721)

**Primary verification is automated.** The repo has comprehensive
`#[tokio::test]` integration coverage in `crates/librefang-api/tests/`,
landed via the #3571 PR series (~30 PRs). Every major route domain is
exercised against a real axum router via `TestServer` (see
`start_test_server*` in `tests/api_integration_test.rs`); the canonical
list is `ls crates/librefang-api/tests/`. CI runs these on every push.

### What you MUST do for any route / wiring change

1. **Add a `#[tokio::test]` against `TestServer`** in the matching
   `tests/*.rs` file. Pattern: spawn router via `start_test_server()`,
   hit the endpoint with `reqwest`, assert status and response shape;
   for write endpoints, follow up with a read and assert the side
   effect. This is the canonical replacement for the old curl checklist
   — it catches missing `server.rs` registrations, un-deserialized
   config fields, kernel↔API type drift, and empty/null payloads.
2. **Run scoped tests locally**: `cargo test -p librefang-api`
   (workspace-wide `cargo test` is forbidden — see Build & Verify above).
3. **Reviewers gate PRs** on the presence of an integration test for
   each new endpoint. PRs that change route shape without a test
   should be sent back.

### When live LLM verification is required (HUMAN-only)

Live daemon + real LLM is needed **only** when the change touches an
LLM call path or end-to-end prompt/metering wiring that integration
tests can't simulate (e.g., real provider streaming, real Groq token
accounting, dashboard HTML smoke). Claude must NOT execute these steps
— they require `cargo build --release` and a long-lived daemon on
port 4545, both blocked by `.claude/hooks/`. Prepare commands and
payloads for the user; they paste output back.

```bash
# Stop any running daemon:
#   Linux/macOS:        pkill -f librefang ; sleep 3
#   Windows / Git Bash: tasklist | grep -i librefang && taskkill //PID <pid> //F && sleep 3

# Build + start with provider key (binary suffix is .exe only on Windows):
cargo build --release -p librefang-cli
GROQ_API_KEY=<key> target/release/librefang start &
sleep 6 && curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4545/api/health

# Real LLM round-trip + side-effect check:
AGENT_ID=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4545/api/agents | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)[0]['id'])")
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:4545/api/agents/$AGENT_ID/message" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Say hello in 5 words."}'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4545/api/budget          # cost should have increased
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4545/api/budget/agents   # per-agent spend visible

# Cleanup: same OS-specific kill command as above.
```

The daemon command is `start` (not `daemon`).

### What was retired

- The old 8-step manual curl checklist (Steps 1–8) is gone; Steps 4
  and 6 are now `#[tokio::test]` cases. Step 7 (dashboard
  `grep -c newComponentName`) is dropped — it broke under Vite
  minification. Dashboard UI verification is the dashboard test
  suite's responsibility (see `crates/librefang-api/dashboard/`).
- The "Key API Endpoints for Testing" table is gone; the canonical
  enumeration is the OpenAPI spec (`openapi.json`, regenerated by the
  pre-commit hook) and the integration tests themselves.

## Architecture Notes
- **Deterministic prompt ordering (#3298)**: anything that reaches an LLM prompt — tool definitions, MCP server summaries, skill registries, hand registries, capability lists, env passthrough lists — MUST be ordered before stringifying. Prefer `BTreeMap` / `BTreeSet` over `HashMap` / `HashSet` for those types so the compiler enforces it; otherwise sort at the boundary. HashMap iteration order varies across processes and silently invalidates provider prompt caches even when content is unchanged. Regression tests live next to each boundary — see `kernel::tests::mcp_summary_is_byte_identical_across_input_orders`, `kernel::tests::mcp_summary_inner_tool_list_is_sorted`, and `librefang_skills::registry::tests::all_tool_definitions_is_deterministic_across_insertion_orders` / `tool_definitions_for_skills_is_deterministic_across_insertion_orders`.
- **Agent workspace layout**: identity files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, etc.) live in `{workspace}/.identity/`, not the workspace root. `read_identity_file()` checks `.identity/` first, falls back to root for pre-migration workspaces. `migrate_identity_files()` is called on every spawn to auto-move any root-level files.
- **Named workspaces** (`[workspaces]` in agent.toml): declare shared directories with `path` (relative to `workspaces_dir`) and `mode` (`rw` / `r`). Multiple agents sharing the same path never collide — identity files stay in their private `.identity/`. Resolved absolute paths are injected into TOOLS.md as `@name → /abs/path (mode)`. See `workspace_setup.rs: ensure_named_workspaces()`.
- `KernelHandle` trait avoids circular deps between runtime and kernel
- `AppState` in `server.rs` bridges kernel to API routes
- New routes must be registered in `server.rs` router AND implemented in `routes.rs`
- Dashboard is React+TanStack Query SPA (not Alpine.js) in `crates/librefang-api/dashboard/`
- **Dashboard data layer rule**: all API access in pages/components MUST go through hooks in `src/lib/queries/` and `src/lib/mutations/`. No `fetch()` or `api.*` calls inline in pages/components. Adding a new endpoint = add a query/mutation hook in the matching domain file, then import it. See `crates/librefang-api/dashboard/AGENTS.md` for details
- **Dashboard query keys**: always use the factories in `src/lib/queries/keys.ts`. Never inline `["foo","bar"]` arrays. Every factory must be hierarchical (`all` / `lists()` / `list(filters)` / `details()` / `detail(id)`) so `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: xxxKeys.all })` invalidates the whole domain
- **Dashboard mutations**: each mutation with side-effects must call `invalidateQueries` with factory keys in `onSuccess` (or `onSettled`). Colocate invalidation with the mutation hook, not at call sites
- Config fields need: struct field + `#[serde(default)]` + Default impl entry + Serialize/Deserialize derives
- **Trait injection pattern**: When runtime needs functionality from extensions/kernel, define a trait in runtime and implement it in kernel (e.g., `McpOAuthProvider`). Never make runtime depend on extensions (circular dep).
- **Auth middleware allowlist**: Unauthenticated endpoints must be added to the `is_public` allowlist in `middleware.rs` — NOT by reordering routes in `server.rs`. The auth layer applies to all routes.
- **Docker callback URLs**: Never bind ephemeral localhost ports for OAuth callbacks in daemon code — the port is unreachable from outside Docker. Route callbacks through the API server's existing port instead.
- **MCP OAuth flow**: Entirely UI-driven — daemon only detects 401 and sets `NeedsAuth` state. PKCE + callback handled by API layer (`routes/mcp_auth.rs`). Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) used when server has `registration_endpoint` but no `client_id`.
- `session_mode` in `AgentManifest` (agent.toml, **not** config.toml) controls whether automated invocations reuse the persistent session (`"persistent"`, default) or create a fresh one (`"new"`). Per-trigger override via `Trigger.session_mode: Option<SessionMode>`. Per-cron override via `CronJob.session_mode: Option<SessionMode>`. Resolution order: per-trigger / per-job override > agent manifest default. Session resolution lives in `execute_llm_agent` (grep `kernel/mod.rs` for the function).
  - **Honors `session_mode`**: event triggers, `agent_send`, **cron jobs** (since #3597 / #3657 — see below).
  - **Ignores `session_mode`**: channel messages (always `SessionId::for_channel(agent,"<channel>:<chat>")`), forks (forced `Persistent` to preserve prompt cache).
  - **Cron + `session_mode`** (resolution helper: `cron::cron_fire_session_override`):
    - Effective mode = per-job `CronJob.session_mode` > agent manifest `session_mode` > historical `Persistent`.
    - `Persistent` (or unset): the cron tick synthesizes `SenderContext{channel:"cron"}` and `send_message_full` derives `SessionId::for_channel(agent,"cron")`, so all fires of all cron jobs for that agent share one `(agent,"cron")` persistent session (historical behaviour, prompt-cache reuse).
    - `New`: `cron_fire_session_override` returns an explicit `SessionId::for_cron_run(agent, "<job_id>:<rfc3339_fire_time>")` which is passed as `session_id_override` into `send_message_full`. The override path wins over the channel-derived branch, so each fire lands on its own deterministic, isolated session — prior fires never leak into the current run, and the persistent `(agent,"cron")` session stays untouched.
  - When creating a trigger or cron, consciously pick: `Persistent` (continuity, cache reuse) vs `New` (isolation, fresh context per fire).
- **Message-history trim cap** is configurable per-agent
  (`agent.toml: max_history_messages`) and globally
  (`config.toml: max_history_messages`). Default is
  `DEFAULT_MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES = 40`; values below
  `MIN_HISTORY_MESSAGES = 4` are clamped up with a warning.
  Resolution: agent override > kernel config > compiled default. See
  `docs/architecture/message-history-trimming.md`.
- **Trigger dispatch concurrency** has three layered caps, scoped to
  the **trigger dispatcher only** (`agent_send`, channel bridges, and
  cron still serialize at the existing per-agent / per-session locks
  inside `send_message_full`). Global `Lane::Trigger` semaphore
  (`config.toml: queue.concurrency.trigger_lane`, default 8) caps
  total in-flight trigger fires kernel-wide. Per-agent semaphore
  (`agent.toml: max_concurrent_invocations`, fallback
  `queue.concurrency.default_per_agent` default 1) caps that one
  agent's parallelism. Per-session mutex applies inside
  `send_message_full` only when the dispatcher materialized a fresh
  `SessionId` — which it does for `session_mode = "new"` fires. The
  resolver auto-clamps `persistent + cap > 1` to 1 with a `WARN` log
  (concurrent writes to a single session's history are undefined).
  Per-agent caps are NOT invalidated on manifest hot-reload — to pick
  up a new cap, **kill the agent and let it respawn** (or restart the
  daemon); an in-place activate/status flip will silently keep the old
  cap. See `docs/architecture/trigger-dispatch-concurrency.md`.
- **Skill workshop** (#3328) passively captures teaching signals from
  successful turns into draft skills under
  `~/.librefang/skills/pending/<agent>/<uuid>.toml`. **Default-on with
  the conservative knob set**: `enabled=true`, `auto_capture=true`,
  `review_mode="heuristic"` (no LLM call), `approval_policy="pending"`
  (every candidate waits for human approve / reject), `max_pending=20`.
  Three signals — `ExplicitInstruction` ("from now on always …"),
  `UserCorrection` ("no, do it like …"), `RepeatedToolPattern` (same
  tool sequence ≥ 3 turns). Approval routes through
  `evolution::create_skill`, so the prompt-injection scan runs at both
  `save_candidate` and `approve_candidate` — every artefact visible to
  the agent has crossed the same security boundary as a marketplace
  skill. LLM refinement (`review_mode="threshold_llm"`) uses the
  dedicated `AuxTask::SkillWorkshopReview` slot and the cheap-tier
  provider chain; when no cheap-tier credentials are configured the
  workshop returns `Indeterminate` rather than billing the operator's
  primary provider, blocking a financial-DoS regression. UUID
  validation guards every storage entry that addresses files by id, so
  a non-UUID id never reaches `Path::join`. CLI: `librefang skill
  pending list / show / approve / reject`. HTTP:
  `GET/POST /api/skills/pending[…]`. Dashboard:
  `PendingSkillsSection` on the Skills page. See
  `docs/architecture/skill-workshop.md`.

## Git Conventions
- **Format**: Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `perf:`, `test:`)
- **No AI / Claude attribution** in commit messages, PR bodies, or
  comments — see "Commit & PR hygiene" under GitHub Collaboration below
  for the canonical rule (the `commit-msg` hook enforces it server-side
  too).
- **Worktree**: Use `git worktree add` on an external disk for new features; fall back to `/tmp/librefang-<feature>` only if no external disk is available. Never develop on the main worktree
- **Worktree continuation = drive to PR**: When asked to continue half-done work in an existing worktree (uncommitted changes or unmerged commits), the workflow is **commit → push → open or update PR**. Don't stop at "local commits only". A new branch needs a fresh PR; an existing branch with an open PR gets a follow-up push to update it. Anything left in the worktree counts as real work — including a regenerated `Cargo.lock` after rebase. Commit it together with the rest of the change; do not `git checkout` it away.

## GitHub Collaboration & Wait Policy

LibreFang is an open-source project with heavy AI-assistant traffic. The
rules below codify the boundaries summarised in `AGENTS.md` ("AI Agent
Collaboration") so that maintainers stay in control of their own PRs and
issue threads.

### Touching other people's work

- **Don't close PRs or issues opened by others** unless the user (the
  maintainer) directly instructs you to. By default, post a comment
  recommending closure with the linking commit / PR and let the
  maintainer pull the trigger. When directed to close, the close
  comment must state the substantive reason (review bugs, superseded
  by, scope mismatch) so the original author understands what went
  wrong — do not attribute the close to "AI" / "Claude", the reason
  itself is what matters.
- **Force-push only to your own branches, only before review.** Once a
  reviewer has loaded the diff, prefer fixup commits or a follow-up PR
  over rewriting history. Force-push to `main` / `master` is blocked by
  `guard-bash-safety.sh` and requires explicit user OK regardless.
- **Don't reassign, re-label, or re-milestone** issues / PRs you did not
  open unless directed. Self-assigning a triage label or adding
  `needs-review` is auto-OK; flipping `priority` / `release` labels is
  not.

### Commit & PR hygiene

- **No Claude / Anthropic / AI attribution** in commit messages, PR
  bodies, or issue comments. The `commit-msg` git hook rejects matching
  strings; the PreToolUse Bash hook catches the inline-flag form. Don't
  try to route around either — the rule exists because attribution
  pollutes `git log` and signals provenance the project does not want to
  imply.
- **One PR ↔ one issue (or one tight cluster).** Don't bundle unrelated
  refactors with the requested change. If you find a real problem
  out-of-scope, open a separate issue or follow-up PR; mention it in the
  current PR's "Out-of-scope follow-ups" section.
- **PR body must enumerate** the substantive changes, the verification
  performed (integration test names, `cargo check --workspace --lib`
  output, scoped `cargo test -p <crate>` runs), and any deferred work.
  Bullet form, no marketing prose.

### CI wait policy

CI is shared infrastructure and frequently slow. Polling it from an AI
session burns turns without producing information.

- **Total polling budget: ~5 minutes, in 60–270s chunks.** Anthropic's
  prompt cache TTL is 5 minutes, so keep each wake-up inside that
  window to keep the cache warm; ~300s is the worst case (cache miss
  without amortizing). Don't reach for 1200s+ "save my turns" waits
  here — that violates the 5 min total cap and reintroduces the long
  `gh run watch` / sleep behaviour the policy is meant to prevent.
  After the total budget is spent, push, leave the run URL in the PR
  / report, and **stop**. (Long waits *are* appropriate elsewhere —
  e.g. an autonomous-loop tick polling for an external job — just not
  for in-session CI polling.)
- **Don't pre-emptively re-run a check** that has not yet failed. Only
  retry after a recorded failure, and only once.
- **Don't open follow-up issues or pivot the plan** while waiting for CI
  or review. If you cannot make further progress without information you
  do not have, the correct action is to report status and yield — not to
  invent more work.
- **Don't add reviewers, flip `ready-for-review`, or `gh pr ready`** on
  someone else's behalf, and don't re-request review on your own PR
  unless a maintainer has explicitly asked you to ping them. Maintainers
  pull work into their queue; AI agents do not push it onto theirs.

### Issue / PR comment etiquette

- **At most two follow-up comments** on the same thread without human
  input. After that, stop and wait — repeated AI-generated pings on a
  silent thread are noise, not progress.
- **Don't comment on threads you have no action on.** "Looks good"
  drive-bys from an AI account add nothing.
- **When you reply, link evidence:** commit SHAs, file paths, test
  names. No vibes-only comments.

### Conflict resolution

- **Latest maintainer intent wins.** When rebasing or resolving merge
  conflicts that touch a human-authored hunk, keep the maintainer's
  edit. If the two sides genuinely disagree, surface the conflict in the
  PR body and ask — don't silently pick the smaller diff.
- **Preserve both sides' intent** during conflict resolution. Dropping a
  hunk because "it'll be reapplied later" is how regressions land.

## Common Gotchas
- Windows: `librefang.exe` may be locked if the daemon is running —
  use `cargo check --lib` or kill the daemon first. (Linux / macOS
  let you overwrite a running binary, so this is not an issue there.)
- `PeerRegistry` is `Option<PeerRegistry>` on kernel but `Option<Arc<PeerRegistry>>` on `AppState` — wrap with `.as_ref().map(|r| Arc::new(r.clone()))`
- Config fields added to `KernelConfig` struct MUST also be added to the `Default` impl or build fails
- `AgentLoopResult` field is `.response` not `.response_text`
- CLI command to start daemon is `start` not `daemon`
- When adding `Option<Arc<dyn Trait>>` fields to structs that derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize`/`Clone`/`Debug`, mark them `#[serde(skip)]` and implement the affected traits manually
- `ErrorTranslator` (from `RequestLanguage`) is `!Send` — any `.await` must happen AFTER `drop(t)`, or the axum handler will fail with a cryptic `Handler<_, _>` trait bound error
- `LIBREFANG_VAULT_KEY` env var must base64-decode to exactly 32 bytes (use `openssl rand -base64 32` which gives 44 chars). 32 ASCII chars ≠ 32 bytes.
- When parallel agents modify the same crate, `Option::None` defaults for new fields will silently compile but disable features. Always write integration tests at the injection site, not just the implementation site.
- On Windows: use `taskkill //PID <pid> //F` (double slashes in MSYS2/Git Bash)
